# Customization

***

For basic customization, all you need to do is edit some Markdown using your favorite text editor. To customize the index page, edit `index.md`

To add a new post, create a `.md` file in the `markdown` folder. It will automatically be added to the listing on the index page.

Formatting follows standard Markdown, a good reference for this is [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/). You can also embed any HTML you'd like.

For more advanced customization, you can edit `index.html` to further customize the index page, `blog.html` to customize the posts, and `style.css` to customize the stylesheet. All pages are generated based off these three files.
